    <p>Executives and others tied to a nonprofit with over $1 billion dollars in business with the city and state make extensive contributions to many of the politicians responsible for distributing and overseeing those contracts, according to campaign finance records and tax disclosures.</p>
    
    <p>The Acacia Network holds over $1 billion in contracts for homelessness and substance abuse programs from New York City and New York State. The organization has grown dramatically while fostering deep connections to many city and state politicians including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., City Comptroller Scott Stringer and State Senator Robert Rodriguez.</p>

    <p>Three donations appear to violate tax laws prohibiting nonprofits from donating to political campaigns. Most, however, are legal--there is no prohibition on nonprofit employees donating to politicians from their own taxed income. But it shows the close connections between politics, money  and poverty in the South Bronx, where elected officials allocate hundreds of millions of dollars annually to service organizations like Acacia that in turn support their election efforts and can provide them high-paying jobs when they leave office.</p>


    <h2>ACACIA'S GROWTH</h2>

    <p>The Acacia Network is one of the largest Latino-run nonprofits in the country.</p>

    <p>To get there, it emphasized expansion and growth.</p>

    <p>One subsidiary, when asked to describe its program's successes on its tax returns, describes itself in terms more like a sales prospectus than a service nonprofit.</p>

    <p>"The growth of Acacia Network Housing has been extraordinary. From an initial $5 million contract with the NYC Department of Homeless Services in 2005, the organization had revenue of approximately 54 million (sic) in 2013, revenue for 2014 was $77 million and revenue for 2015 is $112 million," reads the document. "These sizable revenue increases have resulted in an approximately 44% annual growth rate. Acacia Network Housing, Inc.’s laser focus, however, is not on money but on individuals, families and communities in need. Currently the organization houses 1,366 families and 945 individuals."</p>

    <p>Like a hedge fund, it pursues a growth strategy of acquiring the contracts, clients and assets of other nonprofit groups that have fallen on hard times or regulatory trouble. Through expansions, mergers and acquisitions, the Acacia Network now comprises over 40 affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>

    <p>Its executive compensation matches its business-approach to social services. As CEO of the Acacia Network, Raul Russi’s total compensation nearly tripled between 2009 and 2016, going from $230,518 to $616,980. He has since made over $17,000 in political donations, in addition to donations he raised as an intermediary.</p> 

    <p>But despite the scope and scale of its operations, the organization keeps a low public profile.</p>

    <p>“Acacia is the biggest nonprofit that nobody knows anything about,” said Angelo Falcon, a nationally-renowned expert on the politics of New York’s Puerto Rican community and president of the National Institute for Latino Policy.</p>


    <h2>THE ACACIA DONOR NETWORK</h2>

    <p>But while the nonprofit may not be a household name, it is well-known to politicians. Acacia executives—and sometimes the subsidiaries themselves—have made campaign contributions totaling over $195,000 dating back to 2000.</p>

    <p>The donations come from executives, former executives and subcontractors paid through Acacia's government contracts and programs. RC Consulting Solutions Inc., a consultancy started by former executives Ruben Medina and Carlos Nazario to do business with Acacia donated over $30,000, while Acacia’s private security force donated another $7,500. </p>

    <p>Two nonprofit Acacia subsidiaries, PROMESA Administrative Services Organization and BASICS, even donated almost $2,000 directly to candidates and the Bronx Democratic Party, in apparent violation of the tax code covering nonprofits.</p>

    <p>According to the IRS, "Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity.  Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes."</p>

    <p>Much of this giving is centered around the Bronx and East Harlem, including over $25,000 in donations to the Bronx Democratic County Committee, $10,000 to Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and over $7,000 to Assemblyman Robert Rodriguez. </p>

    <p>In recent years, Acacia has moved into building housing in collaboration with for-profit developers. One of these projects, a 13-story, 220-unit high-rise at 1675 Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, was approved for a zoning change last summer with Diaz Jr.'s approval.</p>

    <div class="cardInfo">Much of the Acacia Network's assets are located in the South Bronx. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. has received $10,000 in Acacia-related political donations.</div>
    </div> 
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>Another project, the 12-story Acacia Gardens in Rodriguez's district in East Harlem, received $67.8 million in city assistance in the form of tax-exempt bonds and low-interest loans. The project received approval in 2016 from then-Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who also spent $2 million in discretionary funds on the project.</p>
      

    <p>Acacia executives donated nearly $6,000 to Mark-Viverito's campaigns directly.</p>

    <p>In addition to contributing to politicians who support their projects directly, they also make contributions to politicians in a position to oversee their contracts. For example, Acacia CEO Raul Russi served as a campaign intermediary for city comptroller Scott Stringer, who has received over $5,000 from him and other Acacia-affiliated persons. </p>

    <p>Stringer, in his position as comptroller, is responsible for monitoring and auditing Acacia’s over $1 billion dollars in city contracts. Stringer listed the city's Department of Homeless Services on a new "Agency Watchlist" of profligate city agencies. Acacia holds four of the top 10 largest DHS contracts, and accounts for 13 percent of the department's total expense contracts. Since Stringer took over as city comptroller in 2013, his office has not conducted any audits of Acacia Network subsidiaries directly.</p>

Since taking office in 2011, he has not audited any Acacia subsidiaries directly.</div>

    </div>

    <h2>A QUESTIONABLE RECORD</h2>

    <p>When state and city officials do audit Acacia groups, they have found repeated instances of gross financial mismanagement and high prices charged for poor services.</p>

    <p>In 2015, a state audit found problems with over 90 percent of the $9 million of expenses it investigated.</p>

    <p>$2.1 million dollars, or 23 percent of the costs examined, were unallowable outright. That included Promesa claiming disallowed costs on earlier audits as program expenses. "In essence, PROMESA initially billed OASAS for almost $400,000 of unallowable expenses and, after repaying, sought to recover their payment plus another $116,000 to make itself more than whole," reads the report.</p> 

    <p>In addition, the audit found that PROMESA charged the state $38,648 for lobbying costs and $55,733 that went towards a holiday party, retreats, golf, meals and an open bar for executives and employees.</p>

    <p>Another $6.1 million of Promesa's claimed expenses were deemed questionable. Most of these involved transactions with related parties to provide administrative services, including other Acacia affiliates like the Promesa Administrative Services Organization, Basics Inc. and SERA Security LLC—the private security firm for which Acacia CEO Raul Russi is listed as the principle agent in incorporation documents filed with the New York Secretary of State. SERA Security Services also made $7,500 in donations to politicians.</p> 

    <p>Another 2015 report found that one Bronx Acacia shelter, The Stadium, charged the city more than twice the city’s listed rate and the rate charged by a comparable shelter, costing the city an additional $20.6 million per year.</p> 

    <p>The final report of the city's Department of Investigation that year found that Acacia charged the city between 2-3 times the area’s median rent to house homeless families in a Brooklyn apartment building with 48 combined fire, building, and housing violations.</p>
        
    <p>Despite these documented issues, Acacia’s combined revenues grew at least $43 million from 2014 and 2015.</p>


    <h2>A LOBBYING FIRM WITH ACCESS</h2>

    <p>This revenue growth coincided with aggressive lobbying of the City Council on the budget. Disclosures show that Acacia paid  $132,000 a year to the MirRam Group for lobbying council members including Mark-Viverito and Comptroller Stringer throughout the budget and capital allocation processes. MirRam, the lobbying firm of Luis Miranda Jr. and former Bronx Democratic Party leader Roberto Ramirez, had been seen by City Hall observers as the main conduit to Mark-Viverito.</p>

    <p>Though Mark-Viverito has since left office, the MirRam ties still provide Acacia with access to an important politician: Carl Heastie, the speaker of the state assembly. Kim Ramos, a former MirRam partner and a one-time board member at Acacia subsidiary Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, now serves as the assembly speaker’s deputy secretary for intergovernmental affairs.</p>

    <img src="images/CarlHeastie.jpg">
    <div class="cardInfo">While Heastie headed the Bronx Democratic Party, Acacia-related individuals donated nearly $25,000 directly to the party in addition to $2,000 directly donated to Heastie's campaign. Acacia President Hector Diaz helped Heastie profit from the sale of a house purchased with funds embezzled from a nonprofit, in violation of a court order.</div>
    </div> 
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>Heastie has other Acacia ties as well. In 2015, the New York Times reported that Acacia’s President Hector Diaz was instrumental in a series of actions that allowed Heastie to profit from the sale of a house his mother purchased with funds embezzled from a different nonprofit, in violation of a court order. Meanwhile, Acacia-affiliated executives, subsidiaries and contractors donated over $24,000 to the Bronx Democratic County Committee while Heastie was the committee’s chair.</p>


    <h2>A REVOLVING DOOR</h2>

    <p>Diaz is just example of Acacia’s executive leadership drawing directly from ranks of former politicians and political appointees.</p>

    <p>Diaz joined Acacia after a long career in Bronx politics. A state assemblyman for over a decade, he left his seat to take a position as Bronx County Clerk in 1997. It was there that he neglected to file a judgement against Heastie’s mother that included a $40,000 restitution payment and an order “to monitor and determine good-faith sale of the house.” As a result, Heastie kept the house after his mother died, taking out mortgages against the property before selling it in 2005 for almost $200,000 more than his mother paid for it.</p>

    <p>The City Council named Diaz to be city clerk in 2008, but he resigned a year later to become president of the Acacia Network. Diaz made $240,979 in 2016.</p>

    </div> 
    </div>
    </div>


    <p>Acacia's CEO, Raul Russi, was a Giuliani appointee and was deeply implicated in a scandal involving disgraced Bronx State Senator Guy Velella.</p>

    <p>In 2002, Velella, a well-connected Republican from the South Bronx and reported ally of Rudy Giuliani was charged with accepting bribes in a 25-count indictment. He would eventually plead guilty to one charge in exchange for a year-long sentence in jail starting in 2004.</p>

    <p>At the time, Russi served as the executive of the little-known Local Conditional Release Commission. The Commission, under Russi’s direction, voted with one abstention to release Velella from jail after serving only three months of his sentence. After pronounced media furor and an inquiry by the city’s Department of Investigation that found serious irregularities, Russi resigned his position and Velella returned to jail.</p> 

    <p>The revolving door swings both ways. In 2015, Governor Andrew Cuomo named Roberto Velez, an Acacia vice president, as his commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services. Velez lasted five months in the position and has since started a private legal practice.</p>

    <p>The revolving door swung again in 2015, when Maria del Carmen Arroyo abruptly resigned from the city council and joined Acacia shortly after.</p> 

    <p>del Carmen Arroyo, daughter of Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo (who received $6,650 in Acacia donations), had a problematic past in both politics and nonprofits. In her short political career, she was implicated in signature fraud, was criticized for paying her husband with campaign funds and benefitted from a nephew's embezzlement from the nonprofit that del Carmen Arroyo once ran.</p>

    <p>Before becoming a councilmember, del Carmen Arroyo was a director at Narco Freedom, an organization which ran three-quarters houses for substance abuse. Narco Freedom collapsed in 2015, after its executives were indicted for massive fraud. The organization's Brooklyn assets and clientele were transferred to the Acacia Network in 2015.</p>

    <p>“In New York City there is an intertwining of elected officials and the nonprofit sectors that gets described by its advocates as a collaborative effort and is largely in reality simply patronage that you can’t do through government sources anymore,” said Thad Calabrese, associate professor of public and nonprofit financial management at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.</p>
